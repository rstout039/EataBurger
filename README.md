# EataBurger
I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Express-Handlebars and an ORM that lets users select what burgers they would like to order.<br>
The users may choose up to 255 different burgers and choose when and what burgers to devour.<br>
The app will also store ewvery burger ordered, whether devoured or not into a database.<br>
When the user submits a burger, the burger name will be displayed on the left side.<br>
The user then may choose to devour the burger, which then will display the burger name that was devoured onto the right side.<br>
